# Sky FABRICation 2
This is a 1.17.1 Fabric modpack!. It is focused on tech progression. Currently it now contains over 99 Quests. These should only teach you the basics in order to give you all the freedom in the modpack without having to do 1000 quests. In addition there are some magic and exploration quests.

## Ages:
### Stone Age:
In the Stone Age you start to build your island. You collect wood, produce dirt, hammer it into stone. You will also need water. Later you will be able to build a cobblestone generator and improve it with a cobblestone funnel. A mob farm is also essential. After you have received your first iron, a new age opens up for you. Here you will also be able to produce lava and build a nether portal.

### Bronze Age:
In the Bronze Age, you will build a smeltary. You can use this to double your products from the ores. You will upgrade your cobblestone funnel to an iron funnel. This gives you access to other raw materials.

### Steam Age:
In the Steam Age you are well on the way to industrialization. The way to electrical energy is no longer too far. The Mod Modern Industrialisation will still be with you for a while.

### Electricity Age:
From here the gates to practically every technology mod are open to you.

### Age of Exploration:
Explore other dimensions or travel to the moon.
