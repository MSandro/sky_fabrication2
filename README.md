# Sky FABRICation 2
This is a 1.17.1 Fabric modpack!. It is focused on tech progression. Currently it now contains over 99 Quests. These should only teach you the basics in order to give you all the freedom in the modpack without having to do 1000 quests. In addition there are some magic and exploration quests.

## Ages:
### Bronze Age:
In the Bronze Age, you will build a smeltary. You can use this to double your products from the ores. You will upgrade your cobblestone funnel to an iron funnel. This gives you access to other raw materials.
### Storage Age:
Here you will learn how to use Tom's Storage and later: Applied Energistics.
### Steam Age:
In theÂ chapter you are well on the way to industrialization. The way to electrical energy is no longer too far. The Mod Modern Industrialisation will still be with you for a while.
### Electric Age - Power:
From here the gates to practically every technology mod are open to you.
### Do some Magic:
This chapter gives you the chance to take a break from your technical progress. Discover Mods like Botania and much more.
